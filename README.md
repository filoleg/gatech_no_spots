gatech_no_spots
===============

A web application that makes registration for classes at Georgia Tech way less painful than it actually is by allowing to directly find information about the class you are interested in with one click. Also, you can sign up to get notified by text when a spot opens in a full class you are interested in, which should give you a lot of free time to allow to do something else other than manually refreshing the class page for hours on end.

Built using Node.js+Express+Mongo+Twilio.

Hosted and is running at http://no-spots-left.me:3000/.
